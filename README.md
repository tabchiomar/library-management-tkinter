For my final project in the first year of engineering, I developed a comprehensive library management application using Python, specifically leveraging the tkinter and customtkinter libraries for the user interface.

The library management application I created offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for organizing and managing a library's resources. With a sleek and intuitive interface, users can easily navigate through the application's various features and perform essential library management tasks.

Please feel free to try all the functionnalities of the application and surely let me know if you have any tips for a better future applications!

For instance, the uploaded database contains multiple users but for testing purposes please note the following logs: (Rank : username:password)

Administrator : admin:admin \\
Librarian : omar:omar  \\
Member : Adherent:123 

Login Interface
