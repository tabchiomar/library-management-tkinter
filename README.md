# pfa-library
For my final project in the first year of engineering, I developed a comprehensive library management application using Python, specifically leveraging the tkinter and customtkinter libraries for the user interface.

The library management application I created offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for organizing and managing a library's resources. With a sleek and intuitive interface, users can easily navigate through the application's various features and perform essential library management tasks.

Please feel free to try all the functionnalities of the application and surely let me know if you have any tips for a better future applications!

For instance, the uploaded database contains multiple users but for testing purposes please note the following logs: (Rank : username:password)

Administrator : admin:admin \\
Librarian : omar:omar  \\
Member : Adherent:123 

I have developped many modules for this application, each one of them is specific for each kind of users (member, librarian or administrator)

-> The member will have only access to books, meaning he will be able to look for books in the list of books available.
-> The librarian has six different modules and his own main interface which will dynamically show different informations to help the employee do its work.
-> The administrator is a librarian who has additionally the module to manage librarians and data analysis features for its library.

Few screenshots of the application :
